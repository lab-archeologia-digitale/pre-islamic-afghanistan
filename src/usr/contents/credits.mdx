# The Italian Archaeological Mission in Pakistan and Afghanistan

The Italian Archaeological Mission (IAM) has a long-standing history of exploration and research in South Asia, with its roots tracing back to the mid-20th century. Established to uncover and document the rich cultural heritage of Pakistan and Afghanistan, the mission has played a pivotal role in revealing the artistic and historical legacy of ancient civilizations in these regions. Its early efforts focused on sites such as Butkara in the Swat Valley, where the team unearthed significant Gandharan Buddhist artifacts that shed light on the synthesis of Greco-Roman and Indian artistic traditions.

Today, IAM continues its work with renewed dedication, employing advanced methodologies to study and preserve cultural heritage in challenging environments. In Afghanistan, the mission has contributed to research at key sites like Tepe Narenj and Mes Aynak, delving into Buddhist art and architecture while addressing the pressing need for heritage conservation amid modern threats. Through collaboration with local and international institutions, IAM remains committed to documenting, safeguarding, and interpreting the archaeological wealth of Pakistan and Afghanistan, ensuring its accessibility for scholars and future generations worldwide.
